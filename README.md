# fancy-name-api
A fun REST API built with Spring Boot that transforms names into themed fantasy titles (e.g., pirate, medieval, sci-fi) using dynamic JSON-based styling. Great example of clean architecture, modular service design, and externalized configuration using resource files.
Supports multiple styles, gender-based title selection, and is ready to power a frontend with GET and POST endpoints.
